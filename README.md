## Creating a Kaggle account

Here is a step by step guide on how to register an account and create a profile on Kaggle. Please remember that Kaggle only allows one profile per user.

1.  Go to the Kaggle website  and click on sign up section.
    
2.  Setup your Kaggle profile by providing a brief bio, picture, location, title and current workplace. You can also add your LinkedIn, GitHub and Facebook accounts so people can contact you.
    
Joining Kaggle is a straightforward process that requires very little time and effort. As a Kaggler, you have access to unlimited data sets, Kaggle competitions, and the Kaggle discussion forum. You can also follow strong Kaggle users to learn from.

**P.S. You will have to create a Kaggle account to complete the free courses and at the end of the program, please share your Kaggle profiles in a Google form that will be shared later on to guarantee your GDSC certifications**

## Doubt solving and Discussions panel

In order to effectively communicate and get your doubts solved, please use the `Discussions` section for this repository. There, you can ask questions and tag my GitHub account @diffrxction and I will try to cover your doubts within the same week. Please do not hesitate when asking for help.

Here's the [link](https://github.com/dsc-tiu/MLStudyJams2022/discussions) to the Discussions panel and here's a [quick guide](https://github.com/dsc-tiu/MLStudyJams2022/discussions/2) on how to ask doubts and engage with fellow community members.

## FAQs

**Q1. How long will this event last?**

A. This event is planned to last 4 weeks but we may extend it to 5 weeks as the later portions involving deep learning and computer vision need some thorough explanation.

**Q2. How will I get my certificates?**

A. After the completion of a course on Kaggle,

For the Kaggle certificates, 
You can find your certificates by navigating to the Courses homepage: [https://www.kaggle.com/learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn).

You will get a certificate for each course that you complete and all the courses are free.

**For the GDSC certificate**, after the completion of all four weeks, you will be asked to submit your Kaggle profile links in a Google form that will be shared later and you will get **a certificate** verifying your participation in the event and we also have **swags** for good consistency throughout the four weeks.
