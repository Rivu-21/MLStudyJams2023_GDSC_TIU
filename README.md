## Creating a Kaggle account

Here is a step by step guide on how to register an account and create a profile on Kaggle. Please remember that Kaggle only allows one profile per user.

1.  Go to the Kaggle website  and click on sign up section.
    
2.  Setup your Kaggle profile by providing a brief bio, picture, location, title and current workplace. You can also add your LinkedIn, GitHub and Facebook accounts so people can contact you.
    
Joining Kaggle is a straightforward process that requires very little time and effort. As a Kaggler, you have access to unlimited data sets, Kaggle competitions, and the Kaggle discussion forum. You can also follow strong Kaggle users to learn from.

**P.S. You will have to create a Kaggle account to complete the free courses and at the end of the program, please share your Kaggle profiles in a Google form that will be shared later on to guarantee your GDSC certifications**

## Doubt-solving

Although the main purpose of raising Issues in a repository is to report bugs and ask for fixes or new features, for our program we will use it to ask for help regarding course material.

In order to effectively communicate and get your doubts solved, please use the `Issues` section for this repository. There, you can tag my GitHub account @diffrxction and I will try to cover your doubts within the same week. Please do not hesitate when asking for help.
